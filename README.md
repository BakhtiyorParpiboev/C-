C++ Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small C++ projects and programs that I created while learning and exploring new concepts in C++. Each project is designed to practice a specific topic or technique, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced programming concepts.
Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, demonstrate my understanding of C++ concepts, and create a portfolio of hands-on examples that showcase problem-solving skills and code implementation.
Projects Included

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the types of projects included:

    Basic Syntax and Operations:
        Simple programs to understand input/output, loops, conditionals, and basic data types.
    Functions and Recursion:
        Examples of custom functions and recursive problem-solving techniques.
    Object-Oriented Programming:
        Small projects that implement classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
    Data Structures:
        Implementation of arrays, vectors, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
    Algorithms:
        Sorting, searching, and other algorithmic challenges.
    File Handling:
        Programs to read from and write to files.
    Miscellaneous Topics:
        Projects that explore pointers, memory management, templates, and more.

How to Use

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-learning-projects.git

Navigate to the project folder and open the desired .cpp file.
Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler:

    g++ -o output program.cpp
    ./output

Future Goals

As I continue learning, I plan to add more projects focusing on:

    Advanced C++ topics like STL, multithreading, and smart pointers.
    Real-world applications such as small games, tools, and utilities.

Contribution
